# Adamiani

### This site is designed as a vow renewal website to be used by those invited to the festivities.

Adamiani is an informative wedding-vow renewal website with the aim of providing the invited guests with a convenient, yet stylish, repository of information regarding the upcoming event. It provides value through its RSVP form, travel and accommodation details, contact details, and the celebration schedule. The development followed a mobile-first approach utilising Bootstrap 5, as many users would need to access the information on the go; when either travelling for the event of on the day itself.

## Five Planes of UX
### Strategy
- **What value does the project provide?** This wedding-renewal website allows guests to the event to see key information included, but not limited to:
	- Who the event is celebrating
	- When and where the event is
	- Travel and accommadation options for the event
- **What are the business needs?** The business in this case would be the couple arranging the event. Their needs would be:
	- Easy way to get RSVP responses
	- An FAQ page that answers basic questions, in order to reduce repeating answers to different invitees
- **Who is the target audience?** The target audience is the invited guests to the vow-renewal service.
- **What are the user requirements and expectations?**
	- An intuitive and simple navigation system.
	- Able to quickly and easily locate relevant information.
	- All functions and links work as expected.
	- External links open in a new browser tab.
	- Any embedded video or audio does not autoplay and has options to play, pause, adjust volume, fullscreen, and share.
	- The functionality and design of the website works regardless of screen size.
	- Contact information readily available.
	- Accessibility.
- **What information is required?** Through previous use of wedding websites, brainstorming, and discussions with friends and colleagues; the following are requirements for an all-encompassing wedding or wedding vow renewal website:
	- **Who?**: A clear indication of who is having the ceremony
	- **When?**: The time and date of the ceremony
	- **Where?**: The location of the ceremony, travel details, and accommodation recommendations
	- **Guests**: What is the dress code and is the event child-friendly?
	- **RSVP**: What are the meal options, when do I need to submit the RSVP by, and can I access this data after sending?
	- **Contact**: The contact details of the couple including social media
	- **Background information**: Background information on the couple and location
- Through research on other wedding websites and blogs; the following criteria were found to be suggested by [The Knot](https://www.theknot.com/content/what-to-put-on-your-wedding-website) and [Wedsites](https://blog.wedsites.com/include-wedding-website/):
	- Rules about social media
	- Local recommendations
	- Link to a registry

#### Viability and Feasibility
Followed is an analysis of the above value and user and business needs:
|   Task |   Importance | Viability/Feasibility |
| --------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| Time and place information section | 5 | 5 |
| Travel and accommodation section | 4 | 4 |
| FAQ section | 5 | 5 |
| Contact details | 4 | 5 |
| Background information section| 3 | 2 |
| Social media links | 2 | 4 |
| RSVP form | 5 | 5 |
| Updates | 3 | 1 |
| Link to wedding register | 1 | 1 |
| Responsive on all devices | 5 | 4 |

### Scope 

#### Content Requirements
A link to the wedding register is deemed unnecessary; as the celebration will include substantial travel for many guests and that their attendance would be gift enough. Likewise; the ability to receive updates to the event will not be considered here as it is outside the purview of this project.
A mobile-first approach is taken to ensure optimal performance on mobile devices and the Bootstrap 5 size limits will be considered when designing each section to make it suitable for all devices (phones, tablets, desktops). On top of this, a hamburger menu will be utilised to hide the navigation menu on smaller screen sizes.

The following proposed web-pages and sections will cover the remaining content and feature requirements established in the strategy plane:

##### Section: Navigation bar
- This section will be present on every page to create a cohesive structure across the site
##### Section: Footer
- This section will be present on every page to create unity across the site
- This section will house contact details, as to be available on every webpage
- The contact details will cover email address, whatsapp, and postal address
- Social media links will be grouped here
##### Webpage: Homepage
- The heading and hero image will convey the time and location of the event
##### Webpage: About Us
- This will house background information on the couple and their journey together
- Mixed media will be used to accentuate the story including images and video footage
##### Webpage: Travel/Accommodation
- This will house sections detailing travel and accommodation options
- Information will be emphasised using mixed media including images, a map, and links to different options
##### Webpage: RSVP
- This page will hold the RSVP form
##### Webpage: FAQ
- This will house a list of Frequently Asked Questions including dress-code and the child-friendly nature of the event
- There will be no images as to not detract from the information


### Structure 
Each page will consist of:
- **Navigation bar**: Meeting the navigation requirement
- **Main section**: Meeting the requirements of the page
- **Footer**: Meeting the contact details and social media requirements

Required pages and their main sections:
- **Home**: Meets the time and place information requirement
    1. Header describing the title of the site and time and location of event
    2. Hero image of the couple
	3. Key information for the user about the ceremony
	4. Key information for the user about the reception
- **About Us**: Meets the the background information requirements
	1. Text of the back-story
	2. Images displaying the journey that the couple has been on together
	3. A video highlighting the original wedding
- **Travel/Accommodation**: Meets the travel and accommodation requirements
	1. Details of how to get there
	2. Map of the location of the event
	3. Details of accommodation recommendations
	4. Images of accommodation recommendations
- **RSVP**: Meets the RSVP requirment
	1. A central form consisting of:
		- Name 
		- Whose plus-one (if applicable)
		- Contact email
		- Dietry restrictions
		- Meal choices
		- A message for the happy couple
		- A song recommendation for the evening disco
		- A submit button
- **FAQ**: Meets the FAQ requirment
	1. Central Q/A paragraphs posing and answering FAQs
	2. Links to other parts of websites if the answers can be found there
	3. Contact information for any other queries

#### Information Architecture

Each page will use the same navigation bar and footer to create a consistent website design that is easy to use and pleasing to look at.
The navigation bar will consist of a site brand/logo linking to the home page and separete links to the other pages. In this way, the user can access the desired part of the website with a single click, well within the 3 click maximum that many websites adhere to.
There will be no sub-category navigation links within each webpage.

#### Interactive Experience
Clickable links will have obvious changes when hovered over to offer clear feedback to the user. Any video content will have controls available to the user and will not autoplay or automatically replay. Any external links such as social media will open in a new tab. Any new content flowing down the page will utilise content hinting where appropriate.

### Skeleton 

[Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/) was used during this section to create wireframes.


To maintain a pleasing layout and consistency throughout the website:
- All pages will follow the same layout to enable easy navigation for the user. They will consist of the same navigation bar arranged at the top of the page, the same footer arranged at the bottom of the page, and a central section providing the page information
- Sections within the pages containing elements will keep to the same size or keep within a ratio of sizes
- The rule of thirds will be kept to where possible 
- The navigation bar and the footer will be the same height
- On smaller (phone) screens the navigation bar will be reduced to a hamburger menu
- On tablet screens "Travel/Accommodation" will be changed to "Travel/Accom"

The **navigation bar** will be organised in the following order:
- Logo: On the top left of the navigation bar, following current accepted convention for its location, it will link to the homepage
- A home button: allowing the user to navigate back to the homepage without having to click the logo
- About us: Third on the navigation bar, allowing the navigation bar to follow the intuitve pattern for wedding websites of home/the couple/travel suggestions/RSVP/FAQ
- Travel: Fourth on the navigation bar, having the most useful information for the user when planning their trip, earning it a place above the RSVP and FAQ
- RSVP: Though important for the business (the couple), RSVP will be placed below the bulk of the information that the user (guest) would need to consult before deciding on their attendence 
- FAQ: Though quite high in importance to the user, this will be placed at the far right of the navigation bar, following current accepted convention, so that the user will intuitively look for it in this location	 

The **footer** will contain a logo, contact details, and social media links that will open in a new tab.
- On smaller (tablet and phone) screens the footer will not show the physical mailing address, as this takes up much needed room and is likely not a requiremnt for the user whilst on the go
- On smaller (tablet and phone) screens the footer will not show the logo, as it takes up too much space that could otherwise be used for more important information such as the contact details and social media links

The **homepage** will be split into four sections on desktop to be clear and conise; a hero image with key information overlayed, a ceremony details and image section (split 2:1), a reception details and image section (split 2:1), and an images section (split 1:1:1) to add some space between the information and footer.
- A link and reminder to RSVP will be included
- On tablet; the ceremony and reception information sections will be split 1:1 with the image, there will only be 2 images in the images section
- On mobile; the overlaid text on the hero image will instead appear below it. The ceremony image will be placed vertically above the ceremony details. Likewise with the reception details and image. The images section preceding the footer will contain only 1 image

The **about us** page will consist of a title with an image underneath and then 4 sections containing an image and text.
- The header section will use take up half of the page width and will be centred
- The text and image sections will also take up half of the page width and will be centred to create a pleasing column effect to the page  
- The images used to accompany the text sections will be small, stylised, and vertically centred
- The order of text/image will be reversed for each section giving the impression of pages in a book
- On tablet; the sections will be set to 100%
- On mobile; the images will be removed from the text sections and instead appear above the footer

The **travel/accommodation** page will consist of a heading, followed by three sections detailing flights, travel to the ceremoney, and travel to the reception. These three sections will be split equalling into a text element with the information, an image, and a map element. Each consecutive section will have the position of the map and image flipped. Before the footer there will be an accommodation section detailing hotel options for three budgets and links to the respective hotel websites.
- At tablet sizes the images will be lost for the flight, ceremony, and travel sections with the containing elements now taking up 50% of the width each
- On tablets the hotel options will be split over two lines, equally sized and centred on the page
- On mobiles the flight, ceremony, and reception details will appear above the map elements and the hotel options will appear on their own lines arranged vertically
- On mobiles the column width for content will take up 70% of the width

The **RSVP** page will consist of a title, a central RSVP form and a border image each side
- On tablet and mobile the border images will be moved to inside the title and below the RSVP form

The **FAQ** page will resemble the RSVP page but with a bootstrap accordion component housing the questions instead of a form

### Surface 

#### Changes from Skeleton
- Collapsing the navigation bar into a burger menu on smaller screens did not look as good as I hoped; instead I kept the navigation icons with some hover effects. This works well, as there are only a handful of navigation icons.
- Due to the number of pages in the navigation bar and to help with the distribution of information; the travel/accommodation page has been split into two separate pages named travel and hotels. 

#### Colour Scheme
I used the colour #E7BCDE as a starting point due to it’s romantic nature and utilised [adobe’s colour wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) to create the following colour palettes:

**Shades**

![shades](docs/images/colour_scheme_shades.png)

**Analogous**

![analogous](docs/images/colour_scheme_analogous.png)

**Complementary**

![complementary](docs/images/colour_scheme_complementary.png)

Chosen colours:
-	#E7BCDE for the background colour to the webpage, including header and footer content and a border around the main content. It is also used for font colour where the font needs to pop against a darker background; for example the hero-text on index.html.
-	#4A3C47 from shades due to it’s dark off-black nature allowing text to stand out clearly on a lighter background
-	#D0BCE8 from analogous for a lighter colour that will stand out against a darker background
-	#A87D9F from complementary for the background colour of hover-able items such as RSVP buttons and the items in the navigation bar
-	#E8C1BC was chosen for a light off-orange colour to be the background of the page sections. This colour was found through experimentation with the starting pink

Extra colours used:
-	#000 (black) was used in parts where the contrast with a lighter background needed to be increased 
-	#fff (white) was used sparingly in the website design
-	#fafafa this off-white was used to colour most of the font awesome icons used in page titles
-	#ff0000 (red) was used to colour the font awesome heart icons on the about us page

Social media links:
-	The hover effects given to the social media links takes them from in the style of the page to the style of the social media platform, representing the transition of one webpage to another when clicked.
-	The facebook icons were coloured with the facebook blue #1877F2 and a white background
-	The X/twitter icon was coloured with white text on a black background
-	The Instagram icon was coloured with black text on a white background to match the site’s favicon; as the actual logo is multicoloured and was not able to be replicated here

#### Typography

I researched elegant fonts typically used for romantic themes and constructed the following “font palette” for my site:

**[Sail](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sail)**:

![sail](docs/images/typography_sail.png)

The elegant lower case letters of Sail, combined with the flourishes on the capital letters lends itself perfectly to my legible site logo and was used for the logos both in the header and footer throughout the website. The back up typefaces provided were Times New Roman, Times, and Serif.

**[Courgette](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Courgette)**:

![courgette](docs/images/typography_courgette.png)

Navigation bar items were styled with Courgette. This capital letters of this font is easy to read at a glance whilst still maintaining elegance. The back up typefaces provided were Times New Roman, Times, and Serif.

**[Meie Script](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Meie+Script)**:

![meie script](docs/images/typography_meie_script.png)

The elegant flowing letters of Meie Script was used for the bride and groom names to convcey elegance and class. The back up typefaces provided were Times New Roman, Times, and Serif.

**[Parisienne](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Parisienne)**:

![parisienne](docs/images/typography_parisienne.png)

Meie Script did not prove legible at smaller font sizes; so parisienne was used for section titles to achieve the same effect. The back up typefaces provided were Arial, Helvetic, and Sans-Serif.

**[Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)**:

![roboto](docs/images/typography_roboto.png)

The text in the contact and hashtags for social media will used the Roboto typeface. This is the most popular font on google fonts, easy to read, and recognisable. The back up typefaces provided were Arial, Helvetic, and Sans-Serif.

#### Images

**About-us**:

- Pages other than the index page will have a page title at the top bringing unity to the site. This has the same pink colour as the hero text on the homepage and is the same height as the navigation bar (120px). It includes a font awesome icon to help the user intuit the purpose and value of the page. Here it is a heart, which is coloured red to resemble love.
- A hero image is placed beneath the title to give some space before the text. It is also set to a multiple of 120px and changes size in response to changing screen sizes.

<details><summary>About Us Title</summary>
<img src="docs/images/feature_about_us_title.png">
</details>

- Then there are repeating sections of images and story text. They swap orientation from right to left and left to right to give the idea of pages in a book and they describe the relationship so far. On desktop and tablet the images are centred vertically to the text to show which part they relate to. On mobile most of the images are removed so as not to clutter the screen and the final image is replaced with the wedding image; deemed the most important and appropriate image. The text width on mobile is extended to compensate for the lack of images.

**RSVP**:
- The RSVP page is split into three columns. The central column contains the page title in the same format as the other pages and the RSVP form. This is flanked on either side by thin border images that really bring the user to the central form.
- This page title has a change of font to Sail, as the Meie Script was deemed inelegant and illegible when in all-caps.
- The RSVP form is preceded by a reminder of the deadline to submit the form; informing the user of the timeline.

<details><summary>RSVP Title</summary>
<img src="docs/images/feature_rsvp_title.png">
</details>

- The RSVP form utilises text inputs, email input, a drop down selection part and radio buttons to gather all information needed by the client. The name, email, and selection of event are required for the form to be submitted, stopping the user from prematurely submitting information.
- The submit button text reads “RSVP” and mimics the colour scheme and the hover effect of the RSVP button from the homepage.

**404**:
- The error 404 page not found page is intentionally simple as to not distract the user with unnecessary media or imply that this page has another use. It consists of a large title explaining the error, a brief whimsical paragraph and a button to return the user to the homepage.
- The button follows the same colour theme and hover effect as the RSVP button on the homepage

## Bugs 

**Bug 1: Clickable area of the navigation bar didn't fully cover the div**
My intention was to make the whole of the naviagtion bar items clickable, rather than just the image or text, but it left a sliver of unlinked element at the bottom as shown here at the bottom of the blue Adamiani logo:

![bug1](docs/images/bug_header_problem.png)

I inspected the elements using google dev tools and found:

![bug1](docs/images/bug_header_inspection.png)

Since I had the anchor element as inline, the height of 120px that I had set was not taking effect. I solved this by adding `display:block;` to the CSS rules for `.navbaritem a {}`.

**Bug 2: Hero image covers navigation bar when you scroll down**
On index.html, after adding the hero image feature, it covered the navigation bar if you were to scroll down the page.

![bug2](docs/images/bug_hero_image_inspection.png)

This was fixed after some research by setting `z-index:1` in the CSS rules for the `.header-section{}` so that it always appears on top.

**Bug 3: Overlapping formatting on the footer on smalle devices**
On smaller screen sizes the footer elements overlapped as such:

![bug3](docs/images/bug_footer_before.png)

This was solved by adding the following CSS rules to hide the text under the social media links and reposition the email address:
<br>
`.gender{display:none;}` <br>
`#instagram-hash, #twitter-hash {display:none;}`<br>
`#email-address {padding-top:20px;}`<br>

This resulted in: <br>
![bug3](docs/images/bug_footer_after.png)

**Bug 4: The accordion header would appear over the navigation bar if it was open and the page scrolled down**
On the FAQ page, if an accordion section was open and the page scrolled down, it would appear above the navigation bar:

![bug4](docs/images/bug_accordion_before.png)

This was fixed by increasing the z-index of the the `.header-section{}` to 10 so that it always appears on top. This fixed the issue as shown here:

![bug4](docs/images/bug_accordion_after.png)

### Mistakes

- Commit nomenclature was altered starting with commit 26 to be more in-line with professional standards. Commits prior to this utilised past-tense language.
- Despite aiming for a mobile-first approach; a desktop first approach was actually taken in the development of this website. Due to my inexperience with HTML and CSS, I found it easier to imagine the layout of the website on desktop first and work towards mobile whilst I practiced and mastered CSS.
